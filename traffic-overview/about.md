# Traffic Overview Reporting

## Motivation

Give stakeholders visibility into website reach and conversion. Monitor changes in top line KPIs and identify which dimension(s) are driving changes over time. Establish grouping and conversion concepts that the organization understands and agrees are important so that those concepts can be leveraged in other contexts (e.g. A/B testing, page engagement analysis).

## Approach

Classify page views and conversion events by many dimensions (in our implementation: device type, page type, channel, geographic, and temporal). Store rolled up summaries in a table organized into different "analysis types" (e.g. "Weekly by Device Type").  Connect Tableau to summary table and visualize summaries.  Report out in a weekly write up + grant all product / engineering / mobilization stakeholders access to the report.
